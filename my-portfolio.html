    <h3>About Me</h3>
  </body>
     <p>I am a son born to Mr and Mrs. Kangogo as their seventh child.Being the last born,I have to try as much as possible to gain much experience and secure a top-paying job to outsmart my siblings.</p>
     <p>I went to Kiram Academy for my primary education and graduated to high school in 2014.I joined Kabarnet high school in 2015 and completed my four-year course in 2018.I managed to attain a B plain(62 pts) and decided to join Moringa School</p>
     <p>I decided to take a class on programming as it is now the path to a top-paying job.</p>
     <p>To anyone who who wants to join a school and take on programming, I advise them to check out <a href="http://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a>. It's a great place to learn web development skills!</p>
     <p>I'm interested in creating mobile applications and websites to ease our day-to-day life.I'm also interested in meeting developers like me.
